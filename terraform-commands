terraform plan -var-file= "stage.tfvars"
The terraform state pull command and the terraform state push command can directly read and write entire state files from and to the configured backend. 
You might need this for obtaining or restoring a state backup.

As terraform output values help us to print the attributes reference values but sometimes you can not print all the values on console.
So to prevent from printing sensitive values on the console you need to set sensitive = true
